**Dummy Agents** is a simulation of agents walking randomly and falling because of each other. They're really clumsy!

Fallen agents are still dangerous - another agent might trip over and fall on their face.

Camera can be moved and zoomed to see the clumsy agents from different angles!

Agents lose health on falling and can disappear because of that. It's good to keep track of your favorite agent, so make sure to select them and watch their HP.

Each Agent is unique - they have different hair color and names. Selecting random name is easy, just find top 100 baby names on Google and put them in a static list!

Agents model was made in [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/), then rigged and animated in Blender.
